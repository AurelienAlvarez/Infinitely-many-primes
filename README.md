# Infinitely-many-primes

* A paper (written in French) which explains the details of this work is in preparation.
* Two Coq files come with this paper:
  * infinitely-many-natural-numbers.v which gives three different proofs of the fact that there exist infinitely many natural integers
  * infinitely-many-primes.v which is a formalization of Euclid' proof of the fact that there exist infinitely many primes. This Coq file is largely inspired by a proof given by Frédéric Blanqui in a blog discussion.
